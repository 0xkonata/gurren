## Overview

### Gurren is a body

Gurren is a cloned minimal proxy contract of a NFT.

You can generate that cheap contract from factory.

Gurren has several feature.

- Gurren can fight with other Gurren.
- Hence it has HP,MP,STR,VIT,DEF,INT,RES,DEX,AGI,LUK,Lv,EXP,TLM(Telomeres)
- Anyone can feed the Spiral Power by burning ETH for the Gurren.
- The Spiral Power increases EXP and TLM and the Gurren's Lv will be up.
- As time passing, TLM will be shorter. When TLM is zero, head will be sent back to the owner and Gurren will be destroyed.


### Lagann is a head

Lagann is a head of Gurren. You can set an NFT onto it.

### What makes me happy then?

The Gurren has a unique ID. And NFT as well has an ID. Hence you can make unique "genome" combination from them.

The genome is a level up bonus foctor. Like PoW, if the genome bytes is closer to zero, the bonus will be bigger.

Several special NFTs which is popular in the crypto sphere has been preset as the "Legendary". It will double (or more) the Lv-up bonus of the Gurren.

### Gaming integration

Via "Gurren SDK", any gaming project can integrate Gurren Status and so on.

It's good for attracting NFT community to your game and game balance would be auto-adjusted by the Telomere rule - active player is stronger.



### Caution

- Gurren's owner can get rid of the head NFT (Lagann) but Gurren's Lv will be reset then.
- You can sell the Gurren on the OpenSea but the head NFT (Lagann) will be sold as well.
